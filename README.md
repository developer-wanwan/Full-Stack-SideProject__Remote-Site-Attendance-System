<h1>Project Title - <b>RFID</b> Attendance System with <i>Website UI</i> & <i>SQL Database</i></h1>
<p>My project is to develop a remote site low-cost <b>RFID</b> Attendance System with <i>Website UI</i> & <i>SQL Database</i></p>
<br>
<h2>Need of the Project</h2>
<p>Since my company seeks to replace inefficient manual recording methods such as roll-calling or signing in on paper, with a reliable & accurate solution, as a system can automatically generate attendance record by using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID reader) and web application tech, instead of traditional manual records, to allow frontline staff can effectively take attendance when arrived & started working there.</p>
<br>
<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<p>My project is to harness IoT tech, incorporating RFID tech seamlessly, to facilitate the transmission of real-time data from RFID readers to a Google application as Google Sheets for technical verification, and even a website user-interface operating in Local Server & Database. By using the interconnected nature of IoT devices and the unique identification capabilities of RFID IC cards, to implement when frontline staff tagging their cards on RFID readers, attendance records would be instantly relayed to a computer terminal through a Wi-Fi network.</p> 
<br>
<p>Also, my system would ensure the prompt generation of accurate attendance records, including time-in, time-out and duration data on the terminal interface, to provide management and HR teams with up-to-date information for pair decision-making, for example, to allow them to calculate each frontline staff’s wage conveniently.</p>
<br>
<p>Ideally, the developing cost of my attendance system would be at a cost not exceeding $200 per site. By keeping the implementation of low-cost, my company can achieve enhanced operational efficiency without incurring significant expenses and allows company’s businesses to adopt modern tracking systems without straining over budgets.</p>
<br>
<h2>System Overview</h2>
<p>My attendance system is necessary to enhance operating seamlessly through a website user- interface hosted on a local server, utilizing web make-up & programming language including PHP, CSS & JavaScript for dynamic functionality, to
facilitating effectively the automatic registration of attendance for each frontline staff.</p>
<br>
<p>My enhanced system will operate as when their individual RFID IC cards tap on the reader, the system captures the card's UID and transmits it to the ESP32 microcontroller. The microcontroller processes this data of the action. This processed data is then sent to an API written by PHP, which interfaces within the system server of web application.</p>
<br>
<p>Once received, the API would store the attendance records in a secure database. Then, the website user-interface displays real-time attendance records, showing staff-information including staff-name, staff-id, card’s UID, staff-department, date, on-duty-time, off-duty-time & duration between on-duty-time & off-duty-time in an organized format, so that my system will allow management team & HR team effectively review and track attendance records of our frontline staff daily. By integrating IoT tech with a web application, my attendance system provides a user-friendly & coordinated solution that streamlines attendance management, ensuring reliability and efficiency in record-keeping.</p>
